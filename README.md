## Introduction

This project implements and evaluates the Uncovering Common Features (UCF) Spatial model for deepfake detection. The model is trained on the FaceForensics++ dataset and tested across WildDeepfake and CelebDF datasets to assess cross-dataset generalization. The model’s performance was optimized through extensive hyperparameter tuning (e.g., batch size, learning rate, noise), and its interpretability was enhanced using tools like TensorBoard, Grad-CAM, and t-SNE.

Additionally, a fairness and bias analysis was conducted, leveraging demographic annotations from the datasets to evaluate the model’s performance across diverse groups. The goal is to develop robust and ethical deepfake detection systems by addressing both technical and societal challenges.

This work provides valuable insights into deepfake detection, with a strong focus on both performance and fairness, while offering an open-source framework for future research.
